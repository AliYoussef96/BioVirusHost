# Statement of need

A simple Python interface to query information from Virus-Host database. Virus-Host DB provides a collection of viruses and their host information, and it is the biggest database present [see](https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/stat.html ).
The need to access the information from the Virus-Host DB in a simple pythonic way is very useful for collecting data about viruses and hosts. BioVirusHost is a package that allows the connection to the Virus-Host DB API and parses information from it.
Virus-Host DB does not provide API documentation or examples, hence BioVirusHost was developed to connect, get, and parse information fast and easy.
